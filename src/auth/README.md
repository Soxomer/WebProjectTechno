The `AuthController` is a TypeScript class that is part of a NestJS application. It is responsible for handling authentication-related HTTP requests.

## Endpoints

### POST /auth/login

This endpoint is used to authenticate a user. It accepts a JSON body with the user's login credentials. The body of the request should follow the `LoginAuthDto` data transfer object schema.

```typescript
interface LoginAuthDto {
  username: string;
  password: string;
}
```

Upon successful authentication, it returns a JWT token that can be used for authenticated requests.

### GET /auth/profile

This endpoint is used to fetch the profile of the authenticated user. It requires a valid JWT token in the `Authorization` header of the request.

The JWT token is validated using the `JwtAuthGuard`. If the token is valid, it fetches the user's profile using the `UsersService`.

## Dependencies

The `AuthController` depends on the `AuthService` and `UsersService`. These services are injected into the controller through its constructor.

- `AuthService`: Used for signing in the user and generating the JWT token.
- `UsersService`: Used for fetching the user's profile.

## Usage

To use the `AuthController`, you need to send HTTP requests to the above endpoints with the required data. The responses from these endpoints can be used for user authentication and profile management in your application.
