This is a WebSocket gateway class in a NestJS application. It uses the `@nestjs/websockets` and `socket.io` libraries to handle WebSocket connections and messages.

## Methods

### create(@MessageBody() createMessageDto: CreateMessageDto, @ConnectedSocket() client: Socket)

This method is triggered when a 'createMessage' event is received. It creates a new message using the `MessagesService` and the data received in `createMessageDto`. The new message is then broadcasted to all other connected clients with the 'newMessage' event.

### findAll()

This method is triggered when a 'findAllMessages' event is received. It returns all messages by calling the `findAll` method of `MessagesService`.

### join(@MessageBody('name') name: string, @ConnectedSocket() client: Socket)

This method is triggered when a 'join' event is received. It allows a client to join the chat by calling the `join` method of `MessagesService` with the client's name and id.
